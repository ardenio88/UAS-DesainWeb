                                    Professor Minerva McGonagall, O.M. (First Class), was a Scottish half-blood
                                    witch, the only daughter of Muggle Robert McGonagall and witch Isobel Ross. She also
                                    was the older sister of Malcolm and Robert Jnr. Minerva attended Hogwarts School of
                                    Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Gryffindor House, but it took the
                                    Sorting Hat five and a half minutes to decide if she was Gryffindor or Ravenclaw,
                                    which made her a Hatstall. During her seventh year, she was appointed Head Girl.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After her education, Minerva worked for two years at the Ministry of Magic and later
                                    returned to Hogwarts, where she became Head of Gryffindor House and the
                                    Transfiguration professor. Though she wasn't a member of the Order of the Phoenix
                                    during the First Wizarding War, Minerva greatly helped the Ministry of Magic's
                                    resistance through spying on Death Eaters and bringing the Aurors crucial
                                    information on their activities.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Eventually, Minerva became concurrently, at differing times, Deputy Headmistress and
                                    Headmistress of Hogwarts. In 1995, she opposed Dolores Umbridge, the High Inquisitor
                                    of Hogwarts. She also protected the students from Alecto and Amycus Carrow from 1997
                                    until 1998. As part of the Order of Phoenix's new resistance movement, Minerva
                                    fought in several battles of both wars, including the Battle of the Astronomy Tower
                                    and the Battle of Hogwarts, where she led the resistance against Lord Voldemort.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Minerva survived the Second Wizarding War and became Headmistress full time, a title
                                    she still held into the early 2020s.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Minerva almost constantly exuded magnanimity and sternness, being held in great
                                    respect (and some fear) by nearly all students and staff. Used to having her way,
                                    she tolerated neither audacity nor silliness from her pupils and was known to turn
                                    cold towards people who said or did things in front of her that were stupid, or if
                                    she thought they were trying to be funny. She was a woman who rarely smiled or
                                    gave compliments freely. Despite her stern demeanour, Minerva did exhibit a dry
                                    sense of humour which usually came out when times were tough. She wasn't afraid to
                                    speak her mind and showed quite a sharp tongue, especially during arguments.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    True to Gryffindor, Minerva valued bravery and courage highly, believing cowardice
                                    be a heavy flaw. She fought the Death Eaters and protected her students, proving her
                                    bravery. Despite her loyalty to her house, Minerva was a fair-minded person who was
                                    known for docking points from students in her own House when she saw it must be
                                    done. Although she permitted of-age students to choose whether they wanted to
                                    stay or evacuate for the Battle of Hogwarts as a respect for their valour and
                                    rights, she gave the strict orders for anyone underage to evacuate, prioritising
                                    their safety over their courage and refusing to let under-qualified children risk
                                    dying in battle despite their desires.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For the most part, though, Minerva usually maintained great emotional composure,
                                    without being indifferent. Although she wasn't always particularly personable, she
                                    could be very warm and supportive during times of trouble or loss and cared a great
                                    deal about her students, both personally and academically. She was known to be
                                    extremely caring in times of tragedy, being known for her kindness in her own
                                    reserved manner. Though it rarely happened, Minerva showed a temper that could
                                    reveal itself on occasions when she was angry or flustered. Apparently, she
                                    shared this temper with her father. Upon seeing Harry's alleged death, Minerva
                                    screamed in such despair that Harry never heard before.
