                                    Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, often shortened to Hogwarts, was the
                                    British wizarding school, located in the Scottish Highlands. It accepted
                                    magical students from Great Britain and Ireland for enrolment. It was a
                                    state-owned school, funded by the Ministry of Magic.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The precise location of the school could never be uncovered because it was rendered
                                    Unplottable. To Muggles, the school appeared to be an old, abandoned castle.
                                    Similarly, most wizarding schools' locations were protected in order to prevent
                                    their ways of teaching being revealed, as well as protect the students and schools
                                    themselves from any harm.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Established around the 10th century, Hogwarts was considered to be one of the finest
                                    magical institutions in the wizarding world, though other notable schools included
                                    Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France, the Durmstrang Institute implied to be in
                                    northern Europe, and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the United
                                    States.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Children with magical abilities were enrolled at birth, and acceptance was confirmed
                                    by owl post at age eleven. However, if the child in question was a Muggle-born or a
                                    half-blood like Harry Potter with no knowledge of the wizarding world, a staff
                                    member from the school visited the child and his or her family in order to inform
                                    them of their magical heritage and the existence of the wizarding world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The school's motto was Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus (Draco Dormiens Nvnqvam
                                    Titillandvs), which, translated from Latin, means "Never tickle a sleeping dragon".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Hogwarts School, located somewhere in the Highlands of Scotland, consisted of the
                                    large Hogwarts Castle and extensive school grounds surrounding it, which included
                                    sloping lawns, flowerbeds, vegetable patches, as well as a loch (called the Black
                                    Lake), a large dense forest (called the Forbidden Forest), several greenhouses and
                                    other outbuildings, and a full-size Quidditch Pitch. One of the castle's towers held
                                    an owlery, which housed all the owls owned by the school and by students.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The castle was set upon huge rocks above the Black Lake. Its three highest towers
                                    were the Astronomy, Ravenclaw, and Gryffindor Towers. The castle's 142 staircases
                                    were known to change position. The castle was known for its many updates and changes
                                    in layout throughout the years.It should be noted that some rooms in the school
                                    tended to "move around", as did the steps on the Grand Staircase. Albus Dumbledore
                                    once noted that even he did not know all of Hogwarts' secrets. The castle had been
                                    around for centuries, and consequently had a long history of ancient magic.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The school had numerous charms and spells on and around it that made it impossible
                                    for a Muggle to see it as the school; rather, they saw only ruins and several
                                    warnings of danger. Witches and wizards could not Apparate or Disapparate in
                                    Hogwarts grounds, except for when the Headmaster lifted the enchantment, whether
                                    only in certain areas or for the entire campus, so as to make the school less
                                    vulnerable when it served the headmaster to allow Apparition. Electricity and
                                    electronic devices were not found at Hogwarts. Due to the high levels of magic,
                                    Muggle substitutes for magic, such as computers, radar and electricity, "went
                                    haywire" around Hogwarts. Radios, however, were an exception as they were not
                                    powered by electricity, but by magic.
                                </p>
