                                <p>
                                    Slytherin was one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
                                    founded by Salazar Slytherin.In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the
                                    Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few particular characteristics he most
                                    valued. Those characteristics included cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, and
                                    ambition.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Many Slytherin students tended to clique together (often acquiring leaders) which
                                    further exemplified Slytherin's ambitious qualities. Examples of these included
                                    Draco Malfoy's gang, Merula Snyde's gang, Pansy Parkinson's gang and the Death
                                    Eaters.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The founder highly valued and favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat
                                    admitted that it could be a factor when being sorted.Students of any blood status
                                    could be placed in the house. However, a Muggle-born student from that house was
                                    considered to be quite rare.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The emblematic animal of the house was a snake and the house's colours were green
                                    and silver. There were two notable heads of the house; Horace Slughorn took the role
                                    twice (first leaving in 1981 and then taking the role again from 1997 until leaving
                                    before 2016), and Severus Snape.The patron ghost of the house was the Bloody Baron.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Slytherin corresponded roughly with the element of water due to serpents being
                                    commonly associated with the sea and lochs in western European mythology, as well as
                                    serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals.Similarly, in Celtic mythology,
                                    water is seen as a portal to another world, leading some to believe that the element
                                    was chosen to symbolise a Slytherin's dream for a world in which their goals and
                                    ambitions had finally been achieved. Others speculate that it was chosen to
                                    symbolise many Slytherins' hope for a pureblood-only wizarding society.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The colours also corresponded with waters around lakes and lochs often being green,
                                    and silver being often associated with grey rainwater.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Salazar Slytherin was a pure-blood supremacist and believed half-bloods and, more
                                    specifically, Muggleborns to be unworthy of being taught magic. Slytherin's views
                                    at the time could have been attributed to the persecution of witches and wizards at
                                    the hand of Muggles during that century.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Slytherin's opposition over the idea to allow witches and wizards from half-blood
                                    and Muggle-born heritage to enrol at Hogwarts during its foundation created great
                                    controversy at the school, and it was the root of a feud between former friends
                                    Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor. Slytherin later decided to leave the school when an
                                    argument started between him and Gryffindor, and they either duelled or started a
                                    civil war between the two houses. Such an argument would be forever known as the
                                    origin of the feud between their two houses and also made them the houses that are
                                    most competitive.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When Slytherin departed Hogwarts, he would leave behind the Chamber of Secrets with
                                    the purpose of an heir opening the chamber one day and unleashing a means to
                                    'protect' the school from those who, in his view, were enemies of magic:
                                    Muggle-borns. The chamber was opened twice and the Serpent of Slytherin was
                                    killed the second time by Harry Potter in 1992.
                                </p>
