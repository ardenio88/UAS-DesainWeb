                                <p>
                                    Hufflepuff was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
                                    Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff was
                                    the most inclusive among the four houses, valuing hard work, dedication, patience,
                                    loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The emblematic animal was a badger, and yellow and black were its house
                                    colours. The Head of Hufflepuff was Pomona Sprout, and the Fat Friar was the
                                    House's patron ghost.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Hufflepuff corresponded roughly to the element of earth, and it was for that
                                    reason that the House colours were chosen: yellow represented wheat, while black was
                                    emblematic of soil. The Hufflepuff point hourglass contained yellow diamonds.
                                    Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrated exceptional abilities in
                                    Herbology, owing to their correspondence to earth.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Students belonging to this house were known to be hard-working, friendly, loyal,
                                    honest and rather impartial. It might be that due to their values, Hufflepuffs were
                                    not as competitive as the other houses, and were more modest about their
                                    accomplishments. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing
                                    hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular
                                    aptitude in its students.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Hufflepuffs were known to have a strong moral code, and a sense of right and wrong.
                                    Hufflepuffs were usually accepting of everyone. Students in Hufflepuff were known to
                                    value everyone and treat them as equal.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Hufflepuff appeared to have the least rivalry with the other houses, except in
                                    Quidditch, although the Triwizard Tournament did temporarily put a great deal of
                                    strain on the relationship between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, due to unusual
                                    circumstances of the selection of both Gryffindor student Harry Potter and
                                    Hufflepuff student Cedric Diggory as champions. This was mended by 1998,
                                    where a majority of Hufflepuffs rose to defend Harry from Pansy Parkinson and later
                                    helped to defend Hogwarts.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    According to Minerva McGonagall, all four of the houses produced exceptional witches
                                    and wizards in their time, but due to Helga Hufflepuff's policy of accepting any
                                    student Hufflepuff is often thought to be the house of less talented wizards and
                                    witches. However, this was merely a misunderstanding of the Sorting Hat's poem.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Hufflepuff house had produced a great number of wizards and witches who would go
                                    on to be extremely successful and have great influence upon the history and course
                                    of the wizarding world, examples of such individuals including the famous
                                    Magizoologist Newton Scamander (a pioneer in the field of Magizoology), Arithmancer
                                    Bridget Wenlock (who discovered the magical properties of the number seven), Hengist
                                    of Woodcroft (founder of the all-wizard village of Hogsmeade) and former Minister
                                    for Magic Artemisia Lufkin (who was the first woman to hold the office and
                                    established the Department of International Magical Co-operation).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What made Hufflepuff differ from the other houses was the fact that they didn't tend
                                    to boast about these accomplishments. It was not considered to be part of their
                                    nature.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Hufflepuff was the house that produced the fewest Dark Wizards throughout its
                                    history. Their cheerful and friendly demeanour could probably account for this
                                    achievement of the House. Hufflepuff firmly demonstrated its loyalty during the
                                    Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, when they were second only to Harry Potter's own house
                                    of Gryffindor in the number of students willing to stay and fight against Voldemort
                                    and his forces in the defence of their school.

                                    Hufflepuff's nature and reputation was perhaps best exemplified by its mascot, the
                                    badger. Though a quiet and largely unassuming creature that most perceive to be
                                    harmless, the badger can be surprisingly vicious if provoked and capable of fighting
                                    off animals many times its size, especially if there is a threat to what it cares
                                    about. Their capacity to be far more dangerous and cunning than their reputation
                                    would suggest, was also shown by the fact that of the four house common rooms,
                                    theirs was the only one that possessed an active defence mechanism against those who
                                    would try to seek unauthorised entry.
