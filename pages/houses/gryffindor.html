                                <p>
                                    Gryffindor was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
                                    and was founded by Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to
                                    choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage,
                                    chivalry, nerve and determination, to be sorted into his house.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The emblematic animal was a lion, and its colours were scarlet and gold. Sir
                                    Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick", was the House
                                    ghost.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Gryffindor corresponded roughly to the element of fire, and it was for this reason
                                    that the colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the house. The colour
                                    of fire corresponded to that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane
                                    and tail and gold representing the coat.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Gryffindor house emphasised the traits of courage as well as "daring, nerve, and
                                    chivalry", and thus its members were generally regarded as brave, though
                                    sometimes to the point of recklessness. Some Gryffindors had also been noted to be
                                    short-tempered.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Notably, Gryffindor house contributed many members to Dumbledore's Army and the
                                    Order of the Phoenix, although this may have been because the main members made
                                    it a point not to associate with other houses.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    According to Phineas Nigellus Black, members of other houses, particularly
                                    Slytherin, sometimes felt that Gryffindors engaged in "pointless heroics". Another
                                    Slytherin, Severus Snape, considered many Gryffindors to be self-righteous and
                                    arrogant, with no regard for rules.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Gryffindors and Slytherins had shared a fierce house rivalry since their founders,
                                    Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin, respectively, had a severe falling out over
                                    Slytherin's emphasis on blood purity. There might also be an element of feeling
                                    wronged, as Harry and his fellow Gryffindors tended to win in a lot of circumstances
                                    which, when viewed from a neutral point of view, may be considered unfair.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Examples of this included the last-minute points awarded by Headmaster Dumbledore at
                                    the End-of-Term Feast, which conveniently put Gryffindor ten points ahead of
                                    Slytherin in the 1991 until 1992 school year. The fact that no points were deducted
                                    for the rule breaking that happened during that night. Harry Potter being permitted
                                    by Professor McGonagall to have his own broomstick for the Gryffindor Quidditch
                                    team, even though first-years were not normally permitted their own broomsticks
                                    because of danger. Members of other houses might have felt that Gryffindor received
                                    favouritism. Many saw Harry Potter being chosen as the fourth competitor in the
                                    Triwizard Tournament as an unfair stealing of Hufflepuff student Cedric Diggory's
                                    thunder.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Overall, however, the houses of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tended to side with
                                    Gryffindor in its rivalry with Slytherin. This was particularly notable during the
                                    Second Wizarding War — the members of Dumbledore's Army were from Gryffindor,
                                    Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw, but the Army lacked any Slytherins. (This, however, could
                                    also have been because news of Dumbledore's Army was passed by word of mouth, and
                                    Harry, who had initially raised it, did not associate with any Slytherins.)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    During the Battle of Hogwarts, the Slytherin students left, while senior students
                                    from the other three houses remained behind to fight against Lord Voldemort and his
                                    army — however, it is also worth noting that while Head of House Professor
                                    Slughorn left with his students, he then returned to the castle with reinforcements
                                    (possibly including senior students) and with Professor McGonagall and Auror
                                    Kingsley Shacklebolt, personally duelled Lord Voldemort. Most of the known Death
                                    Eaters (besides Peter Pettigrew, Quirinus Quirrell, and possibly others) had
                                    been Slytherin House members, and that might have been another reason as to why the
                                    other two houses sided with Gryffindor over Slytherin.
