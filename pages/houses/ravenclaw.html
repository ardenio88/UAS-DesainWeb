                                <p>
                                    Ravenclaw was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
                                    Its founder was the medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of this house were
                                    characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol was
                                    an eagle, and blue and bronze were its colours. The Head of Ravenclaw was Filius
                                    Flitwick, and the House ghost was the Grey Lady, real name Helena
                                    Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ravenclaw corresponded roughly to the element of air, and it was for that reason
                                    that the House colours were chosen; blue and bronze represented the sky and eagle
                                    feathers respectively, both having much to do with air. The Ravenclaw points
                                    hourglass contained blue sapphires.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ravenclaw House prized learning, wisdom, wit, and intellect in its members. Thus,
                                    many Ravenclaws tended to be academically motivated and talented students. They also
                                    prided themselves on being original in their ideas, and methods. It was not unusual
                                    to find Ravenclaw students practising especially different types of magic that other
                                    houses might shun. Hermione Granger, an extremely intelligent witch and the top
                                    student in her year, was sorted into Gryffindor, though she admitted that the
                                    Sorting Hat had seriously considered placing her in Ravenclaw.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Often hard-working and diligent, as often was the case with intellectuals with a
                                    predisposition for academics, some of the pupils sorted under the blue-bronzed eagle
                                    were known to be inclined to dismiss certain social expectations for the sake of
                                    satisfying their own intellectual curiosity. Some of these eventually also ended up
                                    being not only accepted but even celebrated, in spite of being initially subjected
                                    to scorn for their various oddities. Luna Lovegood, for example, was one such
                                    student: eccentric to put it at its mildest, she was a Ravenclaw student who
                                    initially was bullied for her open defiance of conventionality, but ultimately
                                    became a celebrated wizarding naturalist and renowned for her participation in the
                                    legendary Battle of Hogwarts and past membership in Dumbledore's Army. Another
                                    example would be Professor Filius Flitwick, a half-goblin who might have faced scorn
                                    for his short stature earlier in life but went on to become a renowned Duelling
                                    Champion, and subsequently one of the finest and most knowledgable Charms Masters in
                                    the entirety of the wizarding world during his employment at Hogwarts School of
                                    Witchcraft and Wizardry. (The best, according to some of his students).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ravenclaws tended to be curious about the world and paid attention to the world
                                    around them. Ravenclaws were known to be logical and rational. In addition,
                                    Ravenclaw students tended to have abilities regarding Memory. Garrick Ollivander,
                                    for example, possessed an eidetic memory and can remember every wand he has
                                    sold, and Gilderoy Lockhart had an exceptional talent in the Memory Charm.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Even so, not all Ravenclaws were motivated by academic prowess. Examples of such
                                    individuals included Gilderoy Lockhart and Cho Chang, both of whom sought to use the
                                    good name and renown of their house, the inherent expectations of certain academic
                                    prowess that came with being sorted into it as well as the often somewhat natural
                                    ability of its members to gain popularity among their peers, which particularly was
                                    the case of the former, proving true the fact that a good student did not
                                    necessarily make a good witch or wizard.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Minerva McGonagall was a Hatstall, having approximately equal Ravenclaw and
                                    Gryffindor traits; the Sorting Hat finally sorted her into Gryffindor. Hermione
                                    Granger was also considered for Ravenclaw due to her intelligence, but the hat
                                    ultimately decided on Gryffindor once again. Filius Flitwick was in the same
                                    situation at the time of his Sorting, but in his case the Hat decided on Ravenclaw
                                    instead of Gryffindor.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Isolt Sayre, founder of Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, wanted to be a
                                    Ravenclaw as a child, but never got to attend Hogwarts. Her choice of blue as a
                                    colour for the Ilvermorny school uniform was inspired by Ravenclaw.
